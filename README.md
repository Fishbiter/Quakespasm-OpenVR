# Quakespasm-OpenVR
OpenVR support integrated into Quakespasm.

Forked from [Zackin5's OpenVR port of Dominic Szablewski's (Phoboslab) Oculus modification of Quakespasm](https://github.com/Zackin5/Quakespasm-OpenVR)
Forked from [Dominic Szablewski's (Phoboslab) Oculus modification of Quakespasm](https://github.com/phoboslab/Quakespasm-Rift) and utilizing the [OpenVR C wrapper by Ben Newhouse](https://github.com/newhouseb/openvr-c).

# Cvars

* `vr_enabled` – 0: disabled, 1: enabled
* `vr_crosshair` – 0: disabled, 1: point, 2: laser sight
* `vr_crosshair_size` - Sets the diameter of the crosshair dot/laser from 1-32 pixels wide. Default 3.
* `vr_crosshair_depth` – Projection depth for the crosshair. Use `0` to automatically project on nearest wall/entity. Default 0.
* `vr_crosshair_alpha` – Sets the opacity for the crosshair dot/laser. Default 0.25.
* `vr_aimmode` – 7: Head Aiming, 2: Head Aiming + mouse pitch, 3: Mouse aiming, 4: Mouse aiming + mouse pitch, 5: Mouse aims, with YAW decoupled for limited area, 6: Mouse aims, with YAW decoupled for limited area and pitch decoupled completely, 7: controller attached. Default 7. (Note I haven't been very careful about maintaining these other modes, since they're obsolete from my point of view).
* `vr_deadzone` – Deadzone in degrees for `vr_aimmode 5`. Default 30.
* `vr_viewkick`– 0: disables viewkick on player damage/gun fire, 1: enable
* 'vr_world_scale' - 1: Size of the player compared to normal quake character.
* 'vr_floor_offset' - -16: height (in Quake units) of the player's origin off the ground (probably not useful to change)
* 'vr_snap_turn' - 0: If 0, smooth turning, otherwise the size in degrees of each snap turn.

# Note about weapons

Quake's weapons don't seem to be particularly consistently sized or offset. To work around this there are cvars to position/scale correct the weapons. Set up for the default weapons are included but mods may require new offsets.

There are 20 slots for weapon VR offsets. There are 5 cvars for each (nn can be 01 to 20):

* 'vr_wofs_id_nn' : The model name to offset (this name will be shown when equipping a weapon that doesn't have a VR offset
* 'vr_wofs_scale_nn' : The model's scale
* 'vr_wofs_x_nn' : X offset
* 'vr_wofs_y_nn' : Y offset
* 'vr_wofs_z_nn' : Z offset

You can place these in an autoexec.cfg in the mod's directory.
